# Renn.es

*Renn.es* is a non-profit and open shared computer system with a small user base running on Arch Linux. Everything is set up focused on security and simplicity/minimalism. It is operated by privacy red-pilled GNU/Linux enthusiasts, who use it for their daily computing tasks like programming, writing mails, maintaining a website, syncing files, etc. This machine is hosted in Rennes (hence the name), in France (cocorico).

We've got some spare space on this machine that we'd be happy to provide to you. For this you can contact us:

- email to: <tarneo@renn.es> or <spedotte@renn.es>.
- matrix room: [#welcome:matrix.renn.es](https://matrix.to/#/#welcome:matrix.renn.es)

If you pay for an additional domain name, we could set up a fully custom email address for you (\~ \$10-\$15 with a country TLD like .fr).
