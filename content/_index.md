*Renn.es* provides both services which can be accessed from a web browser, and Linux shell accounts which you can SSH into.

Here are some use cases for a shell account:
- Messing around and learning about Linux
- Hosting a website, by syncing HTML pages from your computer. This website (which is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)) is a good example of this.
- Storing (a reasonable amount of) files

## Public services

You are free to use these services as you want. You should be able to create accounts on all of them, you only need to get in touch with us for e-mail accounts as we want to avoid spam on that as much as possible.

## Hardware

We use refurbished/used computers as our servers. The main one is a Fujitsu Primergy tower server with 8 cores at 4 GHz and 32 GB of DDR3 RAM. We also use two Lenovo Thinkcentre 1L PC's for backups and an OVH VPS in case our main server fails.

## Privacy

We believe data is radioactive. We aggregate as little of it as possible. For example, we don't log requests on any of our websites. We will never share any data with third parties. We don't use analytics on our websites.

## Who are we?

We are *tarneo* and *spedotte*, french, privacy red-pilled GNU/Linux enthusiasts. This server is maintained without any profit in mind.
